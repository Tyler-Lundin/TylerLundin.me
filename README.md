My Website!


used to show a little about who I am, what I can do, and how I do it!

I started learning HTML and CSS around the age of 14. It never stuck but I found my way back multiple times until I turned 21. During covid, I went all in on my night shift factory breaks, as well as in my spare time at home.

I learned of something called React that, so I started learning about Javascript and React at the same time! (Bad idea in hindsight!)

Ive spent years now building, breaking, rebuilding, rebreaking, and really just getting my ideas out into the digital world.

Taking on clients is a large step but I am ready for the challenge and commitment to my clients!
