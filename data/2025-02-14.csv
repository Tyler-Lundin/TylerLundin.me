Today was one of those oddly productive days where I'm juggling burnout, ambition, and a deep need to prove I can pull this off.

I've been working on the dashboard for my booking app — polishing the UI, fixing the flow between pages, and just trying to make it feel legit. The design is finally coming together, but I'm realizing that user expectations are subtle — like how ""View"" should probably show a preview, not just dump someone into a config screen. Little stuff like that matters.

Outside of code, I've been thinking about image. My little bro (he's studying marketing) called me out on the tank top photo I've been using for my portfolio. He's not wrong. I like the raw, unfiltered look, but maybe it's time to show a sharper, more composed version of myself. Suit jackets feel alien to me, but if dressing up wins trust and business, I'll adapt. I had a pro-style version mocked up — and honestly? It kind of works.

Life's still messy. I'm staying grounded while trying to get traction, avoid slipping into old patterns, and actually turn my skills into income. I want this webdev hustle to work — not for status, but because I want freedom. No clock to punch, no boss hovering, just me building things I'm proud of.

One line of code, one pitch, one decision at a time.
